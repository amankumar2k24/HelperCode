3. maskable.app/editor       => change your logo icon here that will be look in mobile  after that add it in manifest.json



SERVICE WORKER => serviceworker: This field specifies the location of the service worker JavaScript file and its scope. The service worker is responsible for caching resources and providing offline functionality for your PWA.


4. Now for sevice-workers
   1. Create a new react app by using command ==>   npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa 
    2. after this   copy  service-worker.js  and  serviceWorkerRegisteraion.js file   and paste in into our project in src folder
   3. copy import * as serviceWorkerRegisteraion from "./serviceWorkerRegisteraion"      from new  my-app and paste in our app 
   3. and in index.js  file        in last       serviceWorkerRegisteraion.unRegister()  will be there .. copy and paste it in our app  but change the name from serviceWorkerRegisteraion.unregister()   to    serviceWorkerRegisteraion.register()                                    

this will register our service worker 


if our code is not running in production server  it will not run (service worker)            

To run this or production for temporary purpose .,  write =>  npm run build , serve -s build       command and check the code in lighthouse and generate the report for mobile  (pwa) ...Here we go....
